## Overview

**BudgetBudy** is a personal finance and ledger management app built with **Flutter**. It combines:

- a **daily spending tracker** for your own expenses, and
- a **Khatabook-style party ledger** for tracking who you will give / who you will get money from.

It's designed to streamline **personal finance management**, reduce manual calculation errors, and provide real-time insights using local SQLite storage — all **offline**, no internet required.

## Features

- 📊 **Daily/Weekly/Monthly/Yearly Views**

  Track your spending across multiple time ranges with tabbed navigation.

- 💰 **Category-Based Transactions**

  Add expenses with title, amount, date, and category for better organization.

- 👥 **Khatabook-Style Party Ledger**

  Create parties (contacts) and track "gave" or "got" transactions per party.

- 📈 **Automatic Balance Calculation**

  See **You will give** and **You will get** totals automatically calculated.

- 🎨 **Modern UI Design**

  Clean Material Design with custom fonts (`OpenSans`, `Quicksand`) and color-coded balances.

- 📊 **Visual Analytics**

  Charts and graphs using `fl_chart` for spending patterns and trends.

- 💾 **Offline Storage**

  All data stored locally using SQLite — no backend or internet connection needed.

- 🔄 **Real-Time Updates**

  Provider state management ensures UI updates instantly when data changes.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework/UI**: Flutter, Material Design
- **Language**: Dart
- **State Management**: Provider
- **Local Database**: SQLite (sqflite)
  - Separate databases for spendings (`spendings.db`) and party ledger (`khatabook.db`)
- **Utilities & Libraries**:
  - `intl` – Date formatting and localization
  - `fl_chart` – Beautiful charts and graphs
  - `random_color` – Color utilities for UI
  - `url_launcher` – Open external links

- **Transactions Provider**:
  - Stores list of transactions in memory
  - Persists data via `DBhelp/dbhelper.dart` into `spendings.db`
  - Provides CRUD operations: `addTransactions`, `deleteTransaction`, `fetchTransactions`
  - Filters: daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, recent (last 7 days)
  - Aggregations for charts and totals

### Party Ledger (`Party`, `TransactionModel`)

- **Party Model**:
  - `id`, `name`, `phone`
- **TransactionModel**:
  - `id?`, `partyId`, `amount`, `type (gave/got)`, `date`, `note`

  - Creates and manages `khatabook.db`
  - Tables:
    - `parties` (id, name, phone)
    - `transactions` (linked to parties via foreign key)
  - Provides functions to:
    - Insert/update/delete parties and transactions
    - Compute per-party balance and totals
